# test_jstree

This is a simple REST API that takes an XML file and serves it as a JSON object.

The Flask framework was used to provide a client for testing.

The goal was to practice using a JS library, specifically jsTree(), in a Python app.


## Getting Started
#### To install Flask
```
pip install flask
```
or
```
conda install flask
```

#### To run
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Test JSON endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:5000/json

#### Apps for testing endpoints
You can use Postman or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest).
